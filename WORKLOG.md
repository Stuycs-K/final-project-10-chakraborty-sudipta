### 6/3/24 - 6/4/24

Did premliminary research on the topic and possible implementations. Settled on creating an implementation of the Solitaire Cipher, with an encoder, decoder, and a cracker (if possible) to accompany it.

### 6/5/24
Setup initial project directory structure. It seems that a cracker won't be possible for this, as the insecurity of the cipher comes from a bias that shows up, rather than something like frequency analysis.
